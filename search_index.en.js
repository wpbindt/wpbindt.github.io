automated testing in mind. I spent a good 3 hours writing code where every commit message was some variation of \"the code works, but this test doesn't\". Time spent fixing false failures could be better spent adding/refining features or fixing bugs. It's a waste.\nMost of the time, the cause of these false failures is unnecessary coupling between the automated tests and what they aim to test. This post lists some strategies to mitigate this kind of coupling.\nCoupling\nThere's a number of definitions of coupling floating around, and for some of them the argument in this post is valid, and I'm sure there's some for which it isn't, so let's make sure we're on the same page when I write \"coupling\".\nSuppose we have two things f and g (they might be functions, classes, microservices, etc). Suppose that when we make a change d in f we must make a change in g. Then (and only then) do we say that f is coupled to g with respect to the change d. For example, if f is a function that is called by g, so\n\nthen if we change the name of f to h, we have to change g to\n\nSo f is coupled to g with respect to changing the name of f.\nI don't know who came up with this definition, but I learned it at this talk by Kent Beck. There's also a chapter outlining this definition in his book Tidy First?\nCoupling and automated tests\nLet's see what this definition means for automated tests. It follows from the definition that git commit -m 'fix test x' after making a change d to some component f is a consequence of f being coupled to test x with respect to d.\nSometimes this coupling is inevitable, and completely justified. For example, suppose f is a function which prints \"hello world\" to stdout, and suppose we have a test test_that_f_prints_hello_world which tests that it does. Then changing f to print \"schmooby dooby\" instead of \"hello world\" better force use to change the assert in test_that_f_prints_hello_world as well. That is, f is coupled to test_that_f_prints_hello_world with respect to changes in the string f prints to stdout, and that's inevitable, and I'm okay with that. The behavior of f changed, and the test which checks the behavior of f failed; that's just your test suite working as intended.\nSometimes, this coupling is not justifiable. For example, suppose the hello world function f prints \"hello world\" to stdout by calling print('hello world') somewhere. If we change this call to import sys; sys.stdout.write('hello world'), obviously f still works. It still prints \"hello world\" to stdout. Now, if test_that_f_prints_hello_world fails (in other words, if f is coupled to test_that_f_prints_hello_world1 with respect to changing print to sys.stdout.write in f), that's a false failure. After all, the behavior of f hasn't changed in any way, just its structure. It si precisely this kind of coupling which causes false failures. Moreover, in this post we'll show some methods to avoid this kind of coupling.\nBeing coupled to automated tests with respect to behavioral changes: inevitable, good, expected\nBeing coupled to automated tests with respect to structural changes: unnecessary, time-consuming, (rightly) reduces trust in your test suite\nHow to avoid coupling to tests with respect to structural changes\nThe key to avoiding unnecessary coupling to implementation details is the following truism: \"test code is code\". Any tool you have in your arsenal to achieve loose coupling in \"regular\" code can also be used to decouple your test suite from implementation details. Most of the strategies I'll mention ultimately follow from applying some well-known principle to automated tests.\n\ntest interfaces, not concrete implementations\nincrease the scope of your test\nspec pattern\nprefer fakes over mocks\ndon't fake what you don't own\n\nTest interfaces, not concrete implementations\nIncrease the scope of your test\nSpec pattern\nPrefer fakes over mocks\nDon't fake what you don't own\nSuppose you're implementing some public transport planning application, and your users are complaining that when they use your app they tend to forget to look outside to see if they need to bring an umbrella. You decide to help them out by adding clothing suggestions to your suggested routes. Simple enough, if your user asks for a route from A to B starting at 5:30PM, you do your usual computations, suggest them \"Take bus 9 at 5:32PM\", and you call out to some weather api to see if it's raining at 5:32PM. If it is, your app will suggest \"Take bus 9 at 5:32PM, and bring an umbrella\".\nThankfully, the good folks over at weknowtheweather.com publish a library containing a client class Weather for their API. It has a method is_it_raining, taking a time and a location in the form of GPS coordinates, and returning a boolean which tells whether it's raining then and there. You dutifully include it in your route planning routine somewhere. Maybe, on some high level it used to look something like\n\nand after the change, it looks like\n\nwith PlannedRoute now containing some info on umbrellas.\nSince you're a decent person (and more importantly, because you dislike flaky tests), you decide to write a fake version of Weather for use in your automated tests and your build pipelines. That is, you go directly against the advice of this section, you fake the Weather class, which you do not own. Your fake implementation looks exactly like their class (it has to, otherwise you couldn't substitute it for the real thing in your tests):\n\nThis all works quite well, your users are happy with the umbrella feature, and you forget about it for a while. Then, disaster strikes. The weknowtheweather.com library contains a critical security flaw, and the fix is a couple major versions ahead of the one you're using. Annoyingly, the good folks over at weknowtheweather.com decided to make a backwards-incompatible change in their Weather class. Aside from the critical security patch, the is_it_raining method has been renamed to check_rain_status.\nIn order for things to keep on working with this new version of the weather library, you now have to change two things: the FakeWeather class (git commit -m 'Fix tests'), and the plan_route routine. That is to say, your unit tests are coupled to the weather library with respect to name changes of Weather.is_it_raining.\nLet's see what taking the advice in this section entails. It will get a bit verbose. Probably, the approach would look a little bit like this\n\nAnd instead of injecting Weather into plan_route, you inject an instance of the MyWeather interface:\n\nNow, if the good folks over at weknowtheweather.com decide to rename is_it_raining to check_rain_status, only one class changes, namely the adapter:\n\nThe tests stay unchanged. An added benefit is that the plan_route routine is unchanged as well, which is means you have a lower risk of introducing bugs there. Fewer changes to make, happier developer.\nAh but wait, it seems all is not well with this approach. Let's assume we have no static type check in our build pipeline. Nothing would've stopped us from merging the major Weather version bump without changing the adapter. After all, not a single test hits it.\n","id":"https://wpbindt.github.io/blog/git-commit-fix-tests/","title":"`git commit -m 'fix tests'`"},"https://wpbindt.github.io/blog/indexes-tutorial/":{"body":"General structure\nTalk (15 mins)\nMain point: reading is faster, writing is slower, compound indexes are a thing.\nLab (30 mins)\nMain point: get everyone to a point where they are confident to actively participate in a group discussion on indices.\nIn triples or pairs, depending on how large a fraction of the audience considers themselves comfortable with indexes (triples if few, pairs if many, or maybe just triples regardless).

A parser combinator is a function which combines simpler parsers into more complex ones. This post gives an example of using such parser combinators to construct a parser. We'll see that parser combinators lead to declarative parsers, mirroring almost 1-1 the Backus-Naur form of what we're trying to parse. You'll find the code for this post here.\nDutch postal addresses\nThe kind of strings we'll consider are a simplified form of Dutch postal addresses. Here's an example:\n\nIt consists of\n\na street, TWEEDE BANANANENSTRAAT, which is a bunch of words separated by spaces;\na space;\na house number, 67;\na newline;\na zipcode, consisting of a four-digit number 1012, a space, and two letters AB;\na space\nthe name of the city, which is just a bunch of letters, KOMKOMMERVILLE.\n\nIn reality, it's a little more complicated than that (for example, the two letters in the zipcode cannot be SS, SA, or SD because they refer to nazi organizations from WWII), but we'll consider this simplified version.\nBackus-Naur form\nIn Backus-Naur form, this language can be expressed as\n\nGoing a bit deeper, we can specify the smaller parts, such as\n\nThis can be read as \"a digit sequence is either a single digit, or a single digit followed by a digit sequence\". That is to say, a digit sequence is a positive number of digits. Similarly for word sequence and word. Going even deeper, we get to the smallest parts of the language:\n\nStructured representation of addresses\nWe want to parse Dutch addresses into structured data, so we'll need to have some structure we can parse them into. Here's some classes that kind of follow the structure of Dutch postal addresses:\n\nThey don't capture all the subtleties of our language (for example, the letter part of the zipcode are any two strings, both of which could contain any number of characters), but it's good enough for illustrative purposes. We could improve this by for example adding a __post_init__ to PostalCode:\n\nOr even better, expressing it in the type system rather than validating, by having some Letter class which represents one single letter (for example an enum with 26 members, which I will not write down here).\nParsing addresses\nNow we get to writing a parser for this language using parser combinators. It makes use of a small parser combinator library I wrote, functional_parsing_library, and the code for this section can be found here, so you can play around with the parsers yourself.  We'll start at the bottom of the Backus-Naur form, and work our way up.\nYou're encouraged to follow along in a Python interpreter and play around with the parsers we construct. Install functional_parsing_library with\n\nand run\n\nin a Python interpreter.\nSingle characters\nFirst we define the newline parser:\n\nThis creates a function newline with type signature\n\nwhere ParseResults and CouldNotParse are defined as\n\nThe function newline successfully parses any string to_parse starting with '\\n', resulting in\n\nand it fails to parse any string not starting with '\\n', resulting in CouldNotParse. Note that when newline successfully parses a string, it stores the remainder to be passed on to other parsers.\nSimilarly, we can define a parser whitespace by\n\nOne of a set of tokens\nLet's move up the Backus-Naur form. Next comes the parser for &lt;digit&gt;, which we'll call digit:\n\nHere, we encounter our first combinator |, which can be read as \"or\". That is to say, digit parses any string starting with '0', '1', ..., '9', stores the first character, and passes the remainder of the string on for further parsing. It fails on any string not starting with a digit. Note that we've taken simpler parsers for single characters, like char('0'), and combined them into a more complex parser.\nThe parser letter for &lt;letter&gt; can be defined in a simlar way, which I'll leave as an exercise for the reader.\nSequences\nNext, there's the part about the words and word sequences. These read, for example\n\nThis recursive relation is hard to express in python (word = letter | (letter &amp; word) will result in a NameError if word is not yet defined). But we can rewrite the definition of &lt;word&gt; in a kind of pseudo Backus-Naur form:\n\nAnd for this, functional_parsing_library has a function, many. It takes one parser p parsing strings into some type T, and yields a parser which turns strings into type list[T]. More concretely, the parser many(p) tries to match as many matches for p as possible, and stores the result in a list. For example, parsing the string abc1234 with the parser many(letter) will result in\n\nNow if we define word = many(letter), then word will parse a sequence of letters into a list of characters. But this isn't quite what we want, because we want to model word just as a string. This is where mapping comes into play.\nMapping\nIf we have a function f: A -&gt; B, and a list xs of type list[A], then we can get a list of type list[B] by applying f to each element of xs individually. In short, you run list(map(f, xs)). Parsers admit a similar structure. If we have a parser p for A, and a function f: A -&gt; B, then we can define a parser fmap(f, p) for B by the following recipe:\n\nparse using p, yielding an object result of type A;\napply f to result, yielding an object of type B.\n\nThe operator functional_parsing_library uses for this is *. So the parser fmap(f, p) can be written as f * p.\nAs an example, we can look at the parser many(letter). It parses strings into an object of type list[str]. As our function, we'll take ''.join, which concatenates a list of strings. Now, the parser\n\nwill first parse using the parser many(letter), resulting in a list of characters, and then concatenate them using ''.join, which is exactly what we want!\nAs an exercise, covince yourself that\n\nis a parser that parses sequences of digits into integers.\nSeparator tokens\nNext, we can define a parser for &lt;word-sequence&gt; as follows:\n\nHere, separated_by is a function similar to many in that it parses many matches for a given parser. The difference is that it also matches (and ignores) a separator character. So in this case, we match a bunch of words, separated by whitespaces, and at the end, we join them back together using ' '.join.\nIgnoring tokens\nSometimes, we want to ignore tokens. For example, the definition of &lt;street-address&gt; reads\n\nHere, I really only care about the &lt;street-name&gt; and &lt;house-number&gt; parts, and the whitespace I don't really want to keep. The way to do this in functional_parsing_library is with the &lt; operator. For example,\n\nwill match on word and then whitespace, and then only keep the result of word. So in parsing the string 'abcd ', it will match 'abcd' to word, and ' ' to whitespace, and ultimately result in 'abcd'. I think of &lt; as a little arrow saying \"that one\".\nThe operator &gt; is defined in a similar way (\"that one\", but pointing to the right).\nMapping over multiple arguments\nNow let's try to implement a parser for &lt;street-address&gt;. A street address consists of a street name, followed by a whitespace, and then a house number, and we wish to turn this into an instance of our class StreetAddress. We can treat StreetAddress as a fucntion of two arguments, and we know how to ignore the whitespace, but we don't know how to do sequential parsing yet. The operator &amp; is overloaded to do this:\n\nSo our parser parses a street name (and keeps the result), followed by a whitespace (whcih it ignores), then parses a house number, and finally applies StreetAddress to the two parsed objects.\nAs an aside, under the hood the sequence is a bit different. Actually it first parses street_name &lt; whitespace), then already it partially applies StreetAddress to yield a function\n\nby filling in the street_name argument. Then it parses house_number, to which we finally apply the int -&gt; StreetAddress function to get a StreetAddress. In particular, the statement\n\ndoes not by itself make sense, because we don't know how to combine the string resulting from the left parser with the integer resulting from the right parser. Only when we specify how to combine them (in our case, apply StreetAddress) is the expression valid.\nAs an exercise, implement a parser for &lt;postal-code&gt;. If you get stuck, an implementation can be found here.\nThe full parser\nFinally, we are ready to combine our smaller parsers into a full parser for Dutch addresses:\n\nIn words, parse a street address, followed by a newline, then parse a postal code, followed by a whitespace, and then parse a city name. Finally, apply DutchAddress to the result. And indeed, running this (which you can do here) on our example string yields:\n\nAside from some details, implementing our parser boils down to copying the Backus-Naur form, and flipping it upside down. It's very declarative, and I personally prefer it to other methods. For example, a potential regular expression for parsing these addresses is\n\nand that makes me unhappy. Probably this expression is wrong, but I have funner things to do with my life than debugging regular expressions, for example filing my income tax.\nAs an exercise, try amending this parser to disallow leading 0s in the zipcode. Maybe consider using parser combinators the next time you find yourself in a parsing mood (advent of code is usually a nice place to try).\n","id":"https://wpbindt.github.io/blog/parsing-addresses/","title":"Parsing postal addresses with parser combinators"},"https://wpbindt.github.io/blog/reading-list/":{"body":"Books\nAccelerate\nIt's rare to see an evidence-based book in this field, and this is one.

Internalize it.\nmicroservices.io\nThis and the corresponding book are filled with gems and good insights on microservices architectures.\nUnit and Integration Tests\nI actually disagree with part of this blog post. But it has significantly impacted the way I think about tests, so I include it here.\nI am not a fan of the term unit test. Take five developers, and you'll have five definitions of \"unit test\". What is a unit anyway? This blog post gives a way of categorizing tests more useful than the usual unit-integration-e2e trichotomy. Aside from being poorly defined, there's also no inherent reason to prefer unit over integration over e2e tests (as in the testing pyramid). It's a good rule of thumb, but the underlying reasoning is obscured by vague terms like \"unit\" and \"integration\".\nThis blog post suggests qualifying your tests not in terms of the the discrete categories unit, integration, and e2e, but rather in terms of two metrics: purity, and extent. Roughly, purity is meant in the same sense of purity in functional programming. More I/O is less pure, less is more. The extent of a test is the fraction of your codebase it covers. See the post and its references for more details.\nThe key reason for having automated tests is to prevent changes from breaking your product. That is, ideally, your tests pass if and only if your product works. In particular, if your tests fail, then you want to be able to conclude that your product is broken. Otherwise, why care about failing tests at all? False failures make you distrust your test suite, and make you waste your time on fixing broken tests.\nFlaky tests are a source of false failures, and a hard to debug source at that. As the purity of a test increases, the odds of flakiness lower. Moreover, I/O is slow, so purer tests tend to be faster (by a lot). When possible, prefer tests with high purity.\nFalse failures are also the reason why you sometimes hear the advice \"automated tests should test behavior, not structure\". A failing test on a change which changes only structure and no behavior is a false failure. One way of decoupling your test suite from your code's structure is by increasing the extent of your tests. I'll illustrate this with an example.\nSuppose you have some sorting function sort, composed of two (private) steps, prep_array and finalize:\n\nA high-extent test suite would write tests for just the sort function. A low-extent test suite would have a test for sort, and then have narrower, more focused tests for prep_array and finalize. Now suppose you realize the sort function would be much more understandable in three steps, bumfuzzle_array, discombobulate_array, and finalize_discombobulated. If you do this refactor, the high extent test suite stays green (since it only tests sort), and the low extent suite fails (it tests prep_array and finalize individually). The closer you test to the boundary (the higher the extent of your test), the lower the odds that it tests structure rather than just behavior. When possible, prefer tests with high extent.\nThis example also illustrates a drawback of the high extent approach. Suppose we introduce a bug in prep_array (that is to say, a change which breaks sort). In the high-extent test suite, all our test suite will tell us at first glance is that there's a bug somewhere in sort, but not whether it's in prep_array or finalize. The low extent test suite will tell you right away that the bug is somewhere in prep_array. This is a definite drawback of the high-extent approach, and actually the reason the author gives for preferring the low-extent approach. I don't really have an argument, but I've found in trying both approaches that the good that test specificity does is outweighed by the harm that false failures do.\nParse, don't validate\nThere is always a schema, even if you put your fingers in your ears and go \"LA LA LA LA\".

By the first bullet, there's a good chance I'm wrong about my assumption that there's a 1-1 correspondence between people and their social security number (this is actually an example given by the author, this assumption is actually false). When that turns out to be the case, I'll be in a bad situation because of the second bullet.\nPython Design Patterns\nThis is a well-argued introduction to object-oriented design principles from a pythonic perspective.

That's a good thing.\nIntroduction\nIn this post I go over one aspect of async/await-style concurrency that is frequently cited as a drawback, and show that it's actually big benefit (in my opinion even one of the main benefits). In short, async/await forces you to be explicit about I/O by requiring you to use the async and await keywords. I also discuss my main gripe with async/await, which is that it's easy to accidentally block the event loop.\nRed code, blue code\nThere is a classic blog post by Bob Nystrom explaining why he prefers (for example) Go's concurrency model over the async/await-based ones found in for example Python and C#. It's a classic for a reason, and worth a read. I'll summarize one part of his argument here.\nTo illustrate why async/await is bad/annoying, he invents a convincing allegorical language. The language has so-called \"red functions\" and \"blue functions\". These are just like regular functions, except they adhere to some rules, namely:\n\nin defining a function, you must specify its color, like for example red_def my_red_func(): ... and blue_def my_blue_func(): ...\nto call a red/blue function, you need to use a special syntax, something like red_call my_red_func() or blue_call my_blue_func()\nyou can only call red functions from within red functions. That is, blue_def my_blue_func(): red_call my_red_func() is not allowed.\n\nThe red functions are meant to be a metaphor for async functions, and the blue ones for non-async ones.\nIn this allegorical language, the main problem arises almost immediately. If you have some deep call stack of blue functions, and you want to call a red one on the top of it, you're going to have to go down the call stack and change every blue function on there to a red one. Every single one. That's a lot of paperwork to go through just to call a function! Were these functions non-colored, you could've just called it without touching the entire call stack. Effectively, red (or async) functions will bleed all through your codebase, and soon your entire codebase will consist of nothing but red (async) functions.\nThe author goes into more detail, and has more to say, but it is this specific point I want to focus on here.\nDropping the metaphor: asynchronous code\nWhile I like the colored code metaphor, I also think that by obscuring some aspects of async/await, it makes the argument above seem more persuasive than it deserves to be. In order to drop the metaphor, I'll give a short (and necessarily shallow) introduction to async/await-style concurrency. Various languages support this style of concurrency (for example Python, C# and JavaScript), and more in-depth explanations can probably be found in your language of choice. For Python, you can find one here. Readers familiar with async/await-style concurrency wouldn't miss much in skipping this section.\nAsynchronous programs aim to run several procedures concurrently, and typically it works as follows. Somewhere, somehow, there is a task scheduler running, called the event loop. This event loop is responsible for running your async functions (or coroutines). When a coroutine performs some I/O (call to the database, send an email, etc), it yields control back to the event loop, allowing another coroutine to continue running. The key difference from thread-based concurrency is precisely that. It is not the event loop which decides when to context switch between running coroutines, but the coroutines themselves. Yielding control to the event loop is done using the await keyword.\nIn Python, a coroutine is defined using the async keyword. Consider the snippet\n\nSuppose we run the coroutines hi and ho concurrently (for example using gather). When hi starts running, it prints 'hi', and then immediately yields control back to the event loop using await asyncio.sleep(1.25). The coroutine asyncio.sleep is used here to replace some actual I/O, but it functions the same. Execution for hi will resume after the 1.25 seconds expire. As hi has yielded control back to the event loop, ho can run. It immediately yields control to the event loop with asyncio.sleep. After 0.25 seconds, ho is ready to go again, and since there's no other coroutine holding control, it is allowed to run. It prints 'ho', and it yields control back tot he event loop. And so on.\nIn this example you can see rules 1 and 2 from the allegorical language in action. We use async to define our red functions (its absence defines sync functions), as in rule 1, and we have to use await to call our red functions, as in rule 2.\nTo experience rule 3, consider the snippet\n\nRunning sync_function_1 will raise SyntaxError: 'await' outside async function. Running sync_function_2 will not raise this exception, but it will also not print 'hi'. You can only call async functions from within async functions.\nExpensive and cheap functions\nThe three rules are inconvenient. And when dealing with red/blue functions, that's all they are. Who cares if a function is red or blue? I just want to call it! All these rules seem to do is to make life difficult. However, when dealing with async/sync functions, two of them serve a purpose, and one isn't an inconvenient law in the sense of parking tickets, but rather a natural law, in the sense of gravity.\nThe main difference between synchronous and asynchronous functions is that asynchronous functions might do I/O, and synchronous functions do not. That is, in an I/O-bound system[^1], asynchronous is essentially synonymous with (potentially) expensive, and synchronous with (definitely) cheap. In contrast with color, surely these are properties we're interested in. A function f being expensive versus cheap makes the difference between for _ in range(100): f() being a bad idea versus a complete non-issue.\nRule 1\nSuppose you have a function do_stuff, hundreds of lines long, calling various other functions with similarly well-chosen names. A colleague submits a merge request which uses this function in some loop somewhere. Is this a bad idea? Depends on whether it's cheap or expensive. How can you tell which one it is? In a non-async codebase, the only way is to read it and its dependencies, which can be immensely time-consuming and error-prone. If you're working in an async codebase, it's as simple as looking at the signature:\n\nIt's synchronous, hence cheap, and it took less than a second to find out. This quick inspection is made possible by rule 1: defining an expensive function looks different from defining a cheap function.\nRule 2\nSuppose we can call async functions without using the await keyword, and suppose your colleague submits a merge request containing something like\n\nIs this a bad idea from a performance perspective? Not necessarily, each of the functions f_i could be synchronous. But to find out, you'll have to inspect the signature of each one of them. In a language satisfying rule 2, the snippet might instead look something like\n\nThis makes it immediately clear that this is a pretty expensive change to make.\nRule 3\nRule 3 says essentially the following: if f is cheap, and g is expensive, then if we change f so as to call g, then f becomes expensive. That is to say, if you call an expensive function in another function, that other function becomes expensive automatically. Or, to put it conversely, you cannot call an expensive function from a cheap function. Not cannot as in \"it is not allowed\", rather cannot as in \"it's a logical contradiction\". This is not a rule so much as a fact of life. A natural law. It doesn't need motivation, it just is.\nIn summary: functions either do or do not do I/O. This is inherent to the function. Choosing whether or not to have rules 1 and 2 in your language is essentially choosing whether you want want to be honest with yourself and to make this explicit and easily inspected, or implicit and hidden in implementation. Rule 3 is a necessary consequence of choosing to have rules 1 and 2.\nBut all my code will be red!\nNot necessarily. Check out these hexagons:\n\nSuppose your application is structured along the lines of hexagonal architecture[^2]. The nested hexagon above is a schematic representation of such an application. The outer shell represents the code responsible for communicating with the outside world. It might consist of communication with the database, code for publishing messages to your message broker, or a server receiving API calls. The inner hexagon represents your domain layer. It contains the business logic. The basic idea is that the dependencies flow inward. That is, the outer layer depends on the inner layer, not the other way around.\nThe outer layer necessarily consists of async functions, since they (by definition) do I/O. The domain is called by the outer layer, but since asynchronous functions can call synchronous ones, this makes it perfectly possible for your domain layer to be completely synchronous.\nFor example, one part of the outer layer might look something like this:\n\nHere the I/O all happens in the repositories (which connect to the database or something like that), and the assign_courier method, which presumably makes some complicated business computations, is free to be synchronous.\nAn actual drawback\nNow that it's clear that being explicit about I/O is actually a good thing, in this section I want to acknowledge async/await is not all sunshine and roses, and talk about what I consider to be its main drawback.\nAsynchronous code has the following footgun: You cannot run asynchronous functions inside synchronous functions, but nothing logically prevents you from running expensive synchronous code inside asynchronous code. To give a trivial example:\n\nWhy is this bad? Well, as discussed in the section on the async/await paradigm, coroutines are themselves responsible for yielding control back to the event loop. Moreover, only one coroutine runs at a time, so until my_async_function yields back control, other coroutines are blocked from continuing. The example above would block all other coroutines from running for 10 seconds straight, which is really bad!\nThe given example is very artificial, so it's tempting to dismiss it as an easily avoided mistake. But any synchronous code doing I/O or CPU intensive computations can cause this, and this kind of issue is hard to lint for, so it can (and will) sneak up on you. The next section gives an example I've seen in production of such a footgun going off.\nExample: logging in Python\nLogging in Python is done using Logger objects and Handler objects. The Logger objects are responsible for accepting logs from the developer. These Logger objects have a number of Handler objects. These Handler are responsible for emitting these logs to various places, such as files, Graylog, or stdout/stderr. These Handler objects are called as such because they handle the emission of log records. Sometimes naming things well is easy!\nFor example, in the snippet\n\nthe string 'hi mom' is sent to stderr.\nA developer familiar with Python's logging functionality might put\n\nin their code and not think twice about it. Since we don't know what handlers are attached to the logger, each of which might do some I/O (if only our code could clearly indicate which functions do I/O and which don't!), this snippet potentially blocks the event loop.\nHow to do logging in async Python\nFor completeness' sake, let's look at how you could go about logging in an async Python application. One way of doing so is with logging.handlers.QueueHandler. Instead of emitting the log records directly to whatever log aggregator you have, QueueHandler puts them (non-blockingly) on a queue which some async-compatible log emitter can listen to. For example,\n\nThe final line runs the log emission as a background task. Now the I/O needed for log aggregation is running in a coroutine, and will not block other coroutines when emitting logs.\nThis solution is still fraught with footguns. For example, all it takes for the above to break down is for some unsuspecting developer to run getLogger('my_logger').addHandler(BlockingHandler()) somewhere else, and our logger is back to blocking the event loop.\nSome more pros and cons\nMostly Python-specific, but may apply to other languages.\nCons:\n\nIf your language didn't support async/await from the get-go (as is the case for Python), chances are you're dealing with an ecosystem which is not built for async/await. See the logging example. To integrate with non-async third parties, you have to make use of threads to emulate asynchronous code. This comes with the extra cost of context switching, and all the other drawbacks of multithreaded code.\nYou are limited to fairly specific IPC methods. asyncio is built upon the select() system call, which really only works for sockets.\n\nPros:\n\nPit of success: if your domain is synchronous, then doing I/O inside your domain is painful, since you have to go down the call stack and make everything async. This makes it harder to fall into such anti-patterns as lazy loading or disconnected domain model.\nSince your code is single-threaded (barring thread pool based escape hatches), you eliminate certain things which make multi-threaded code hard to reason about, such as access to shared resources.\nYour code is more explicit about when exactly it does I/O, and that's actually a good thing.\n\n[1] I/O bound means that the execution time of the program is primarily made up of waiting on I/O, rather than being made up of expensive computations.\n[2] A similar argument applies to applications structured according to functional core, imperative shell.\n","id":"https://wpbindt.github.io/blog/red-code-blue-code/","title":"Red code, blue code, and honesty"}},"docInfo":{"https://wpbindt.github.io/":{"body":0,"title":0},"https://wpbindt.github.io/blog/":{"body":0,"title":3},"https://wpbindt.github.io/blog/git-commit-fix-tests/":{"body":684,"title":5},"https://wpbindt.github.io/blog/indexes-tutorial/":{"body":242,"title":6},"https://wpbindt.github.io/blog/parsing-addresses/":{"body":880,"title":5},"https://wpbindt.github.io/blog/reading-list/":{"body":939,"title":2},"https://wpbindt.github.io/blog/red-code-blue-code/":{"body":1282,"title":5}},"length":7},"lang":"English"}
