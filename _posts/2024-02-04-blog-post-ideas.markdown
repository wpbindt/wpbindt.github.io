## Some blog posts I want to write
# You cannot "have" CI, you *do* it
Main point: CI is not the same as running a build pipeline tool like Jenkins, Travis, GitLab CI, or GitHub Actions. It's not a product you buy and then *own*. It's something you *do*. CI stands for continuous integration, and that means that you *integrate continuously*. That is, **developers merge their code to mainline once a day**, sometimes more. If that's not the case in your team, then your team doesn't do CI. Nor do you "have" it, because that's logically impossible. That's like saying you "have" driving a car, or you "have" eating with fork and knife.

Add command line tool `do_i_do_ci` which analyzes some repo and tells you yes or no.

Probably reduce italics, bolds, and scare quotes.
